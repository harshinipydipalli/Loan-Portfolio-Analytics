/* For a bank, interest income is the primary source of revenue from lending.
Banks don’t call disbursed loan amounts (amount that is lended) as  income — they are assets on the balance sheet (the bank expects to get them back).
You might see loan disbursement rising 📈 but if interest income is flat/declining, it could mean:
More loans are being given at lower interest rates (thin margins).
Higher defaults → less collected interest.

If interest income suddenly dips while loan amounts remain steady, it signals:
Delayed repayments or defaults are increasing.

Different loan types (Retail, SME, Corporate) have different interest yields.
Tracking income trends helps see if the bank is leaning toward high-margin retail loans or low-margin corporate loans.
Strategic Decision Making : 
Management can use it to decide
Do we push more retail loans?
Should we adjust our pricing (interest rates)?
Where do we allocate lending capital next?

/* Net Interest Contribution=Interest Income (from loans)−Interest Expense (paid on deposits/borrowings)
Interest Income → what the bank earns by lending money (loans, mortgages, credit).
Interest Expense → what the bank pays out to customers on deposits (FD, savings accounts) or to other banks/markets if it borrows funds.
So NIC tells us how much the bank actually keeps as profit after paying for the money it uses to lend.

Why is NIC important?
Profitability Lens :
If you only look at interest income, you may think the bank is doing well.
But if deposit interest (expense) is also high, the real gain could be much smaller.
NIC reveals the true profitability of lending activities.

Efficiency of Lending Strategy
A rising NIC means the bank is:
Charging higher lending rates (or)
Lowering deposit/borrowing costs.
Falling NIC could mean shrinking margins (e.g., competition forcing low loan rates, but still paying high deposit rates).

Risk-Adjusted Return
Even with high disbursement volumes, if NIC is thin, the bank may not have enough buffer against defaults.
NIC helps balance growth vs safety.

Investor & Regulator Focus
Investors watch NIC/Net Interest Margin (NIM) to judge bank health.
Regulators monitor it to ensure banks aren’t over-exposed by lending at too-thin margins.

Example
Loan disbursed: ₹1,000 Cr @ 10% → Interest Income = ₹100 Cr

Deposits collected: ₹800 Cr @ 6% → Interest Expense = ₹48 Cr
Borrowed funds: ₹200 Cr @ 7% → Interest Expense = ₹14 Cr (borrowsd funds are the one that bank is borrowed from RBI, other banks, etc)

Net Interest Contribution = 100 – (48 + 14) = ₹38 Cr
